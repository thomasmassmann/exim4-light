Description
===========

This cookbook installs and configures exim4 for client or outbound relayhost.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tmassman/exim4-light.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tmassman/exim4-light)

Requirements
============

## Platform:

* Debian 6.0+

May work on other platforms with or without modification.

Attributes
==========

See `attributes/default.rb` for default values.

* `node['exim4']['user']` - The exim4 user.
* `node['exim4']['configtype']` - The main configuration type. One of
  `internet`, `smarthost`, `satellite`, `local` or `none`.
* `node['exim4']['other_hostnames']`- Is used to build the local_domains list,
  together with `localhost. This is the list of domains for which this
  machine should consider itself the final destination.
* `node['exim4']['local_interfaces']`- List of IP addresses the Exim daemon
  should listen on. If this is left empty, Exim listens on all interfaces.
* `node['exim4']['readhost']`- For `smarthost` and `satellite` it is possible
  to hide the local mailname in the headers of outgoing mail and replace it
  with this value instead, using rewriting.
* `node['exim4']['mailname']`- The visible mail name of the system (see also
  /etc/mailname).
* `node['exim4']['relay_domains']`- Is a list of domains for which we accept
  mail from anywhere on the Internet but which are not delivered locally, e.g.
  because this machine serves as secondary MX for these domains.
* `node['exim4']['minimaldns']`- Boolean option to activate some option to
  minimize DNS lookups.
* `node['exim4']['relay_nets']`- A list of machines for which we serve as
  smarthost. Please note that `127.0.0.1` and `::1` are always permitted to
  relay since `/usr/lib/sendmail` is available anyway and relay control
  doesn't make sense here.
* `node['exim4']['use_split_config']`- Boolean option that controls whether
  `update-exim4.conf` uses `/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template` (`false`) or the
  multiple files below `/etc/exim4/conf.d` (`true`) as input.
* `node['exim4']['hide_mailname']`- Boolean option that controls whether the
  local mailname in the headers of outgoing mail should be hidden. (Only
  effective for `smarthost` and `satellite`.
* `node['exim4']['localdelivery']`- Name of the default transport for local
  mail delivery. Defaults to mail_spool if unset, use maildir_home for
  delivery to `~/Maildir/`.
* `node['exim4']['smarthost_server']`- Server to which all outgoing
  mail is passed to and that takes care of delivering it. All deliveries go
  out to TCP port 25 unless a different port is specified (use
  `smarthost_port`). Colons in IPv6 addresses need to be doubled. If a port
  number follows, IP addresses may be enclosed in brackets, which might be
  the only possibility to specify delivery to an IPv6 address and a different
  port.
* `node['exim4']['smarthost_port']` - TCP port for the mail server. If no port
  is given exim uses 25 by default.
* `node['exim4']['smarthost_login']`- Login used for the smarthost.
* `node['exim4']['smarthost_pwd']`- Password used for the smarthost.
* `node['exim4']['encrypted']['enabled']`- Enable usage of encrypted data bag
  for smarthost credentials.
* `node['exim4']['encrypted']['bag']`- Name of the encrypted data bag.
* `node['exim4']['encrypted']['item']`- Name of the encrypted data bag item.
* `node['exim4']['other_options']` - Hash of other options for update-exim4.conf.conf.


Usage
=====

Include the `recipe[exim4-light]` in your node or role runlist. By default
exim4 will be unconfigured. Set at least the `node['exim4']['configtype']`.

It is recommended to use an encrypted data bag to store your credentials. To
enable this feature, set `node['exim4']['encrypted']['enabled']` to `true` and
set the data bag and item names accordingly.
